Deploying pipelines just got easier. Looper helps you deploy your current pipeline across a cluster or server with minimal effort on your part.

Looper is a lightweight python toolkit for managing pipeline job creation and submission. To get started, proceed with the :doc:`Introduction <intro>` or use the table of contents below to navigate the docs.

Sister projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Pypiper <http://pypiper.readthedocs.io/>`_ and `Looper <http://looper.readthedocs.io/>`_ work together as a comprehensive pipeline management system. `Pypiper <http://pypiper.readthedocs.io/>`_ builds individual, single-sample pipelines that can be run one sample at a time. `Looper <http://looper.readthedocs.io/>`_ then processes groups of samples, submitting appropriate pipelines to a cluster or server. The two projects are independent and can be used separately, but they are most powerful when combined.

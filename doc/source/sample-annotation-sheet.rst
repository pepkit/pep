Sample annotation sheet
**************************************************

The ``sample annotation sheet`` is a csv file containing information about all samples in a project. This should be regarded as an immutable and the most important piece of metadata in a project. **One row corresponds to one sample** (or, more specifically, one pipeline run).

A sample annotation sheet may contain any number of columns you need for your project. You can think of these columns as `sample attributes`, and you may use these columns later in your pipelines or analysis (for example, you could define a column called ``organism`` and use this to adjust the reference genome to use for each sample).

Certain keyword columns are required or provide looper-specific features.

Required columns are:

- ``sample_name`` - a **unique** string identifying each sample [1]_.
- ``library`` - the source of data for the sample (*e.g.* ATAC-seq, RNA-seq, RRBS).
- A column specifying a data file (default name is ``data_source``).

Recommended columns are:

- ``organism`` - a string identifying the organism ("human", "mouse", "mixed").

Any additional columns become attributes of your sample and will be part of the project's metadata for the samples.

Special columns
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Mostly, you have complete control over any other column names you want to add, but there are a few reserved names that Looper treats differently. In addition to the required columns (``sample_name`` and ``library), here's a list of other reserved special column names:

- ``run``. If the value of this column is not 1, Looper will not submit the pipeline for that sample. This enables you to submit a subset of samples.
- ``data_source``. This column is used by default to specify the location of the input data file. Usually you want your annotation sheet to specify the locations of files corresponding to each sample. You can use this to simplify pointing to file locations with a neat string-replacement method that keeps things clean and portable. For more details, see :ref:`advanced-derived-columns`.

.. [1] This should be a string without whitespace (space, tabs, etc...). If it contains whitespace, an error will be thrown. Similarly, looper will not allow any duplicate entries under sample_name.
